### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Technical Business Systems Analyst & Scrum Master at LVVWD, previously at UnitedHealth Group, Scientific Games & Caesars Entertaiment.
- 🌱 I am also currently learning HTML, CSS, & JavaScript (#100Devs), as well as delving deeper into SQL, Agile & Scrum methodologies, and DevOps within my current     role in my career! However, I am looking to learn more and delve deeper into Software Development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with JavaScript, Python & C#.
- 💬 Ask me about Data & Business Analysis, Agile, Scrum, & SQL!
- 📫 How to reach me: gguereque326@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love gaming, built my own PC, and am recently getting more into my fitness and my overall health/wellbeing. I have started taking Muay Thai classes as well as frequenting the gym.
