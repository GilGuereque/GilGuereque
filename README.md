### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I am also currently learning HTML, CSS, & JavaScript (#100Devs), as well as delving deeper into SQL, Agile & Scrum methodologies, and DevOps within my current     role in my career! However, I am looking to learn more and delve deeper into Software Development and the C# programming language in general.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with JavaScript, C# & Python.
